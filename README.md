# Prediction of Credit Card Approval

An Applied Data Science Project part of the D590 - ADS course that focuses on exploring the dataset using key Data Science functions like data cleaning, EDA and modelling of data. The objective here is to develop an accurate Machine Learning model and build a web application to display the predictions of Credit card approval. As Bank representatives manually approve credit cards for applicants, this could involve some man made errors by overlooking on certain criteria and potential customers could be rejected from getting credit cards. With the use of ML model trained accurately, the model can approve elgible card holders.

## How it works

The dataset selected will be explored extensively, visualise its distribution, assess any outliers and clean the data if needed. Once the data is ready, different supervised ML models will be trained using the data. The best prediction model will be selcted based on model evaluation metrics. The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details/data).

For the user interation in our web app, we will implement an interactive feature that will allow a user (banking representative) to enter their potential customerâ€™s information and receive a response regarding the likelihood of them being approved for a credit card, based on the initial input data. Additionally, our service could be extended to individual customers as well, based on its general accessibility and usefulness in many different areas. The application will feature charts as well, to display the data related to the relationships between individual characteristics. This includes various plots, such as scatter, bar, etc. Based on further analysis, we will select the most meaningful graphs to display on our webpage.
